## Ubuntu LTS version with some extra commands
 [![Docker Hub; nimmis/ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/dockerhub-nimmis%2Fubuntu-green.svg)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nimmis/ubuntu)[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/nimmis/ubuntu.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/nimmis/ubuntu "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")|

This is a docker images with different LTS versions of Ubuntu with a working init process and syslog


### Why use this image

The unix process ID 1 is the process to receive the SIGTERM signal when you execute a 

	docker stop <container ID>

if the container has the command `CMD ["bash"]` then bash process will get the SIGTERM signal and terminate.
All other processes running on the system will just stop without the possibility to shutdown correclty

### News

If access to internet the container will automaticly set correct timezone

### my_init init script

In this container i have a scipt that handles the init process an uses the [supervisor system](http://supervisord.org/index.html) to start
the daemons to run and also catch signals (SIGTERM) to shutdown all processes started by supervisord. This is a modified version of
an init script made by Phusion. I've modified it to use supervisor in stead of runit. There are also two directories to run scripts
before any daemon is started.

#### Run script once /etc/my_runonce

All executable in this directory is run at start, after completion the script is removed from the directory

#### Run script every start /etc/my_runalways

All executable in this directory is run at every start of the container, ie, at `docker run` and `docker start`

#### Permanent output to docker log when starting container

Each time the container is started the content of the file /tmp/startup.log is displayed so if your startup scripts generate 
vital information to be shown please add that information to that file. This information can be retrieved anytime by
executing `docker logs <container id>`

### cron daemon

In many cases there are som need of things happening att given intervalls, default no cron processs is started
in the standard ubuntu image. In this image cron is running together with logrotate to stop the logdfiles to be
to big on log running containers.

### syslog-ng

No all services works without a syslog daemon, if you don't have one running those messages is lost in space,
all messages sent via the syslog daemon is saved in /var/log/syslog

### Docker fixes 

Also there are fixed (besides the init process) associated with running ubuntu inside a docker container.

### New commands autostarted by supervisord

To add other processes to run automatically, add a file ending with .conf  in /etc/supervisor/conf.d/ 
with a layout like this (/etc/supervisor/conf.d/myprogram.conf) 

	[program:myprogram]
	command=/usr/bin/myprogram

`myprogram` is the name of this process when working with supervisctl.

Output logs std and error is found in /var/log/supervisor/ and the files begins with the <defined name><-stdout|-stderr>superervisor*.log

For more settings please consult the [manual FOR supervisor](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#program-x-section-settings)

#### starting commands from /etc/init.d/ or commands that detach with my_service

The supervisor process assumes that a command that ends has stopped so if the command detach it will try to restart it. To work around this
problem I have written an extra command to be used for these commands. First you have to make a normal start/stop command and place it in
the /etc/init.d that starts the program with

	/etc/init.d/command start or
	service command start

and stops with

        /etc/init.d/command stop or
        service command stop

Configure the configure-file (/etc/supervisor/conf.d/myprogram.conf)

	[program:myprogram]
	command=/my_service myprogram

There is an optional parameter, to run a script after a service has start, e.g to run the script /usr/local/bin/postproc.sh av myprogram is started

        [program:myprogram]
        command=/my_service myprogram /usr/local/bin/postproc.sh

### Output information to docker logs

The console output is owned by the my_init process so any output from commands won't show in the docker log. To send a text from any command, either at startup or during run, append the output to the file **/var/log/startup.log**, e.g sending specific text to log

	echo "Application is finished" >> /var/log/startup.log

or output from script

	/usr/local/bin/myscript >> /var/log/startup.log

### Added som normaly used commands

There are a number of commands that most uses and adds to their build, in this build I've added som commonly used packages

Extra included packages are

- wget
- curl
- zip/unzip
- git
- vim
- nano
- psmisc
- less
- patch
- software-properties-common

### Installation

This continer should normaly run as a daemon i.e with the `-d` flag attached

	docker run -d nimmis/ubuntu

but if you want to check if all services has been started correctly you can start with the following command

	docker run -ti nimmis/ubuntu

the output, if working correctly should be

	docker run -ti nimmis/ubuntu14
	*** open logfile
	*** Run files in /etc/my_runonce/
	*** Run files in /etc/my_runalways/
	*** Running /etc/rc.local...
	*** Booting supervisor daemon...
	*** Supervisor started as PID 11
	2015-01-02 10:45:43,750 CRIT Set uid to user 0
	*** Started processes via Supervisor......
	crond                            RUNNING    pid 15, uptime 0:00:02
	syslog-ng                        RUNNING    pid 14, uptime 0:00:02

pressing a CTRL-C in that window  or running `docker stop <container ID>` will generate the following output

	*** Shutting down supervisor daemon (PID 11)...
	*** Killing all processes...

you can the restart that container with 

	docker start <container ID>

Accessing the container with a bash shell can be done with

	docker exec -ti <container ID> /bin/bash

### Commands and Environment variables

This is the commands and environment variables  used inside nimmis based containers
for extra functionality

## set_tz

In the default configuration is set to UTC time, if you need it
to use the correct time you can change to timezone for the container 
with this command, syntax is

	set_tz <timezone>

To get list of available timezones do

	set_tz list

### determine timezone automaticly

If the docker container har access to internet it will determine the timezone from the obtained IP

### set timezone on startup

Add the environment variable TIMEZONE to the desired timezone, i.e to set timezone to 
CET Stockhome

	docker run -d -e TIMEZONE=Europa/Stockholm nimmis/ubuntu

### set timezone in running container

Execute the command on the container as

	docker exec -ti <docker ID> set_tz Europa/Stockholm

### get list of timezones before starting container

Execute the following command, it will list available timezones and then
remove the container

	docker run --rm nimmis/ubuntu set_tz list

## Issues

1. Look to see if someone already filled the bug, if not add a new one.
2. Add a good title and description with the following information.
 - if possible an copy of the output from **cat /etc/BUILDS/*** from inside the container
